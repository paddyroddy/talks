# Quarto

## Motivation

- Always found making presentations tedious.
- Prefer non-[WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editors since
  discovering LaTeX.
- [LaTeX Beamer](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer) presentations are
  heavy duty and look rubbish.
- Wanted to be able to version control my slides.
- Was never sure where to store my slides.
- No real record of my talks, so little motivation to give them.
- Quarto allows me to make lightweight, distributable slides that look great.

# Repository Contents

My setup. In the order the repository files appear on GitHub.

## `/.github/workflows/add-to-project.yaml` {footer=false}

GitHub Action to add issues to project board.

```{.yaml}
{{< include ../.github/workflows/add-to-project.yaml >}}
```

## `/.github/workflows/links.yaml`

GitHub Action to perform link checking with [lychee](https://lychee.cli.rs).

```{.yaml}
{{< include ../.github/workflows/links.yaml >}}
```

## `/.github/workflows/linting.yaml` {footer=false}

GitHub Action to perform linting with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) and

## `/.github/workflows/publish.yaml`

GitHub Action to publish the Quarto website to GitHub Pages.

```{.yaml}
{{< include ../.github/workflows/publish.yaml >}}
```

## `/_extensions/`

Extensions are a powerful way to change and extend the behaviour of Quarto. Can
be installed with `quarto add <extension>`, which must be committed to the
repository.

- [jmbuhr/qrcode](https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-qrcode): provides shortcodes
  for [qrcodejs](https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs) in Quarto.
- [quarto-ext/fontawesome](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome): provides
  support including free icons provided by
  [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com).

## `/_filters/slugify.lua`

If the base features of Pandoc and Quarto do not do exactly what you need, you
can likely create a [Pandoc Filter](https://pandoc.org/filters.html) that
bridges the gap. This filter slugifies the given title to be used within a URL.

```{.lua}
{{< include ../_filters/slugify.lua >}}
```

## `/_includes/qr-code.qmd`

This snippet is included at the start of every presentation with
`{{{< /_includes/qr-code.qmd >}}}`.

<!-- Here explicitly to avoid processing of the shortcode commands -->

```{.markdown code-line-numbers="1|3,10|3,5,10|3,7-8,10"}
# {data-menu-title="QR Code"}

::: {layout="[22,78]"}

Scan to view the slides
