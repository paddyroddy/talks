> DevOps is a method in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set
> of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software
> development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and
> shortening the systems development life cycle. DevOps is complementary to
> agile software development; many DevOps aspects came from the agile way of
> working. Automation is an important part of DevOps. Software programmers and
> architects should use "fitness functions" to keep their software in check.
