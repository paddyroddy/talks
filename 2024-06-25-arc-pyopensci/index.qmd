- JOSS is a **developer friendly**, open access
journal for research software packages.

- I previously gave a talk on JOSS, the recording of which can be [accessed

## What Exactly Do You Mean by 'Journal'?

- The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an academic journal (ISSN
2475-9066) with a formal peer review process that is designed to improve the
quality of the software submitted. Upon acceptance into JOSS, a Crossref DOI is
minted and we list your paper on the JOSS website.

## Don't We Have Enough Journals Already?

- Perhaps, and in a perfect world we'd rather papers about software weren't
necessary but we recognize that for most researchers, papers and not software
are the currency of academic research and that citations are required for a good
career.

- We built this journal because we believe that after you've done the hard work
of writing  great software, it shouldn't take weeks and months to write a paper
about your work.


## You Said Developer Friendly, What Do You mMan?

- We have a simple submission workflow and [extensive
documentation](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html)
to help you prepare your submission. If your software is already well documented
then paper preparation should take no more than an hour.

- You can read more about our motivations to build JOSS in our [announcement blog
post](https://www.arfon.org/announcing-the-journal-of-open-source-software).

- We support the scientific Python tools that drive open science through peer
review, training and community building.

- We build diverse community that supports free and open Python tools for
processing scientific data. We also build technical skills needed to contribute
to open source and that support open science. Join our global community.
