## A New Subgroup?

- What skills are there currently in the group?
- Monthly HPC Hour-like meeting?
- `Area: DevOps` label in `research-software-opportunities`
- Get the ball rolling (again) at TI (I won't be there ðŸ˜ž)
- What training/skills do we want as a group?
- What overlap does DevOps have with the other subgroups?
- How can we collaborate with ISD to share training opportunities?

## What is DevOps? {data-menu-title="What is DevOps? (i)"}

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps):

> DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a
> set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of
> software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving
> and shortening the systems development life cycle. DevOps is complementary to
> agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of
> working. Automation is an important part of DevOps. Software programmers and
> architects should use "fitness functions" to keep their software in check.

## What is DevOps? {data-menu-title="What is DevOps? (ii)"}

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps):

> ... academics and practitioners have not developed a universal definition for
> the term "DevOps". Most often, DevOps is characterised by key principles:
> `shared ownership`, `workflow automation`, and `rapid feedback`. ... "a set of
> practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system
> and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high
> quality". ... At its most successful, DevOps is a combination of specific
> practices, culture change, and tools.

[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/devops):

> Building software is a team sport. In preparation for the upcoming sprint,
> teams must workshop to explore, organise, and prioritise ideas. Ideas must
> align to strategic goals and deliver customer impact. Agile can help guide
> DevOps teams.

> Continuous integration (CI) allows multiple developers to contribute to a

> run to ensure correctness before integration. Merging and testing code often
> help development teams gain reassurance in the quality and predictability of
> code once deployed.

> than all at once. This approach improves velocity, productivity, and
> sustainability of software development teams.

# Conclusions

## {data-menu-title="Summary"}

- Portmanteau of "development" and "operations"
- Many different definitions out there
- Everyone is doing some part of the DevOps lifecycle
- New subgroup = new opportunities
- Training opportunities out there
- Need to identify skill gaps/requirements
- Join the `#subgroup-devops` Slack channel
- Talk at TI!
