# Introduction

## Dependencies Are Inevitable

## Why Use Renovate? {data-menu-title="Why Use Renovate? (i)"}

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = YES -->

## Why Use Renovate? {data-menu-title="Why Use Renovate? (ii)"}

- Supports monorepo architectures with workspaces with no extra configuration
- Bot behaviour is customisable via configuration files (config as code)
- Use ESLint-like shared config presets for ease of use and simplifying
  configuration (JSON format only)
- Lock files are supported and updated in the same commit, including immediately
  resolving conflicts whenever PRs are merged

## Why Use Renovate? {data-menu-title="Why Use Renovate? (iii)"}

- Get replacement PRs to migrate from a deprecated dependency to the community
  suggested replacement, works with most managers, see
  [issue 14149](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/14149) for
  exceptions
- Open source (installable via npm/Yarn or Docker Hub) so can be self-hosted or
  used via the Mend Renovate App

{{< include /quarto-making-talks/_slides/footers.qmd >}}

## Config is Reusable

```{.json code-line-numbers="2|4|5|7-13"}
{
  $schema: "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  extends: [
    "github>paddyroddy/.github//renovate/default-config.json5",
    "schedule:monthly",
  ],
  "pre-commit": {
    fileMatch: [
      "precommit/general/general-hooks.yaml",
      "precommit/latex/latex-hooks.yaml",
      "precommit/python/python-hooks.yaml",
    ],
  },

# Conclusions

- Be careful with CI use in private projects (ask MIRSG ðŸ˜‰)
- Embrace automerging
- Renovate `renovates` itself often
- There's always more to learn
