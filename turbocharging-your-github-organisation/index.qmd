Much of this talk holds true for personal GitHub accounts as well as GitHub organisations. However, it is not always the case. I will focus solely on organisational accounts here.

:::

# Special Repositories

## .github-private

The `/profile/README.md` will appear on the GitHub organisation's member
profile, visible only to organisation members.

## .github {data-menu-title=".github (i)"}

The `/profile/README.md` will appear on the organisation's profile.

## .github {data-menu-title=".github (ii)"}

Can add issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` that will be seen in all
organisation repositories, unless the repository itself specifies its own set of
issue templates.
