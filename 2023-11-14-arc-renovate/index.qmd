## Why Use Renovate?

::: {.nonincremental}
::: panel-tabset
### 1

- Get automated Pull Requests to update your dependencies
  - Reduce noise by running Renovate on a schedule, for example:
    - on weekends
    - outside of working hours
    - each week
    - each month

### 2

- Relevant package files are discovered automatically
- Supports monorepo architectures with workspaces with no extra configuration
- Bot behavior is customisable via configuration files (config as code)
- Use ESLint-like shared config presets for ease of use and simplifying
  configuration (JSON format only)

### 3

- Lock files are supported and updated in the same commit, including immediately
  resolving conflicts whenever PRs are merged
- Get replacement PRs to migrate from a deprecated dependency to the community
  suggested replacement, works with most managers, see
  [issue 14149](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/14149){.external target="_blank"}
  for exceptions

### 4

- Open source (installable via npm/Yarn or Docker Hub) so can be self-hosted or
  used via the Mend Renovate App
