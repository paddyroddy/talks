# Testing

## Unit Tests

- Low level
- Close to the source of the application
- Tests individual methods/functions
- Cheap to automate
- Run quickly

## Integration Tests

- Verifies that different part of the application work well together
- e.g. test interaction with database/make sure microservices work together
- More expensive to run
- Many parts of the application need to be up and running

## Functional Tests

- Focus on business requirements of application
- Only verify the output of an action
- In comparison to an integration test it would be a specific value from the
  database rather than just the connection

## End-to-End Tests

- Replicates user behaviour in a complete application environment
- Verifies that user flows work as expected
- Can be as simple loading a web page
- Expensive to perform
- Hard to maintain when automated
- Only need a few

## Acceptance Testing

## Performance Testing

## Smoke Testing

## Miscellaneous

- Mutation Testing
- Mocking
