# Testing

## Unit Tests

- Low level
- Close to the source of the application
- Tests individual methods/functions
- Cheap to automate
- Run quickly

## Integration Tests

- Verifies that different part of the application work well together
- e.g. test interaction with database/make sure microservices work together
- More expensive to run
- Many parts of the application need to be up and running
