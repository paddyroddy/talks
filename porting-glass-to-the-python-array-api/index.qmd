# GLASS: Generator for Large Scale Structure

## Overview

::: {layout-nrow="2"}

::: {.cell}

[GLASS](https://glass.readthedocs.io) is a code used in cosmology to generate
simulations of the full observable universe. In its current form, the primary
user base of the code are collaborations for large galaxy surveys, which are a
cornerstone of modern cosmology.

## The Aim {footer=false}

1. Transform GLASS into a GPU-enabled code.
2. Improve the performance of simulations with GPU acceleration.
3. Implement and adapt parallel processing elements that utilise GPU
   capabilities.
4. Optimise GLASS for modern GPU architectures.
5. Enable differentiable simulations using JAX (in part or in full).
6. Embed GLASS within N-body simulations running on GPU infrastructure for
   post-processing.

# Python Array API Standard

## What Are Arrays

- N-dimensional, grid-like data structure.
- `numpy.ndarray` is the most well known.
- "Rectangular" shape data type.
- Fast, easy to manipulate.
- Ubiquitous.

## The Array Ecosystem

![[Aaron Meurer: Python Array API Standard, SciPy 2023](https://youtu.be/16rB-fosAWw)](figures/ecosystem.png){fig-alt="A
graphic denoting popular array provider libraries and array consumer
libraries."}

## Motivation: End Users

- Ability to switch array libraries without rewriting the whole code base.
- Avoid repeated transfers between array libraries or devices.
- Enable experimentation:
  - Test new hardware.
  - Use functionality specific to an array library.

## Motivation: Array _Providing_ Libraries

- Existing libraries:
  - Interoperability with new consuming libraries.
  - Collaborative API decisions with other array libraries
- New libraries:
  - Concrete API to implement.
  - Guaranteed compatibility with consuming libraries.

## Motivation: Array _Consuming_ Libraries

- Offer users with hardware acceleration and interoperability.
- But without additional maintenance burden.
- Library remains relevant when the community switches to a new array library.
