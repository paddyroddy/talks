# GLASS: Generator for Large Scale Structure

## Overview

::: {layout-nrow="2"}

::: {.cell}

GLASS is a library for performing the kind of simulation that is useful in the
field of cosmology. The code was originally designed to simulate cosmic matter,
weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy positions.

## The Aim

# Python Array API Standard

## What Are Arrays

- N-dimensional, grid-like data structure.
- `numpy.ndarray` is the most well known.
- "Rectangular" shape data type.
- Fast, easy to manipulate.
- Ubiquitous.

## The Array Ecosystem

libraries."}

## Motivation: End Users

- Ability to switch array libraries without rewriting the whole code base.
- Avoid repeated transfers between array libraries or devices.
- Enable experimentation:
  - Test new hardware.
  - Use functionality specific to an array library.

## Motivation: Array _Providing_ Libraries

- Existing libraries:
  - Interoperability with new consuming libraries.
  - Collaborative API decisions with other array libraries
- New libraries:
  - Concrete API to implement.
  - Guaranteed compatibility with consuming libraries.

## Motivation: Array _Consuming_ Libraries

- Offer users with hardware acceleration and interoperability.
- But without additional maintenance burden.
- Library remains relevant when the community switches to a new array library.
