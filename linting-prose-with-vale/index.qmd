# Introduction

## What is Vale? {data-menu-title="What is Vale? (i)"}

Vale is a command-line tool that brings code-like linting to prose. Vale is
cross-platform, written in Go, and
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale).

Vale is not a general-purpose writing aid. It does not teach you how to write;
it is a tool for writers.

Vale focuses (primarily) on the style of writing rather than its grammatical
correctnessâ€”making it fundamentally different from, for example,
[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com).

Vale focuses on ensuring consistency across multiple authors (according to
customizable guidelines) rather than the general "correctness" of a single
author's work.
