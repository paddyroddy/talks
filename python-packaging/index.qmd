# Introduction

## What is a Python Package

- A Python package is a toolbox that can be used to perform a variety of tasks.
- A directory with a specific file structure.
- The directory has modules (`.py` extension).
- Modules allow one to group and structure Python code.
- Modules contain functions and classes.

## Python Packages are Installable

- Allows one to add functionality within the package's code to any Python
  environment.
- Packages can then simply be imported (`import numpy`).
- Installing a package into an environment enables re-use across projects.
- Structuring code as a package is the first step.

## Why Create a Python Package {data-menu-title="Why Create a Python Package (i)"}

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = YES -->

- Use your code across different projects:
  - Allows one to install code into any Python environment.
  - Can import functions and classes into any workflow.
- Build community around your code:
  - Packages make it easier for others to work on it.
  - Version control (`git`) makes it easy to track changes and contribute.
  - Tools such as issues and pull requests aid outside users to contribute.

## Why Create a Python Package {data-menu-title="Why Create a Python Package (ii)"}

- Share your code:
  - Can be installed on any machine using a single command (`pip`/`conda`).
- Organise your code:
  - Packages can help organise large code projects.
  - Smaller, more manageable components.
  - Structure can help both supporting the codebase and making it easier to
    understand.

## What to Consider Before Creating a Package

- Who will use your package?
- How people might use your project?
- If relevant, what data will be used with your package?
- Have you got documentation and tests?
- How long will you be able to support it?

## The Elements of a Python Package {data-menu-title="The Elements of a Python Package (i)"}

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = YES -->

- Code: functions and classes that contain the functionality.
- Documentation:
  - Installation instructions.
  - Tutorials.
  - Examples.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - Development documentation.

## The Elements of a Python Package {data-menu-title="The Elements of a Python Package (ii)"}

- Tests: ensure code works as expected.
- Open source licence:
  - Allows others to use your package.
  - Provides legal direction.
- Infrastructure:
  - Automate updates.
  - Test suites.
  - Publication workflow.
