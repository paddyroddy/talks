# Introduction

## What is a Python Package

- A Python package is a toolbox that can be used to perform a variety of tasks.
- A directory with a specific file structure.
- The directory has modules (`.py` extension).
- Modules allow one to group and structure Python code.
- Modules contain functions and classes.

## Python Packages are Installable

- Allows one to add functionality within the package's code to any Python
  environment.
- Packages can then simply be imported (`import numpy`).
- Installing a package into an environment enables re-use across projects.
- Structuring code as a package is the first step.

## Why Create a Python Package {data-menu-title="Why Create a Python Package (i)"}

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = YES -->

- Use your code across different projects:
  - Allows one to install code into any Python environment.
  - Can import functions and classes into any workflow.
- Build community around your code:
  - Packages make it easier for others to work on it.
  - Version control (`git`) makes it easy to track changes and contribute.
  - Tools such as issues and pull requests aid outside users to contribute.

## Why Create a Python Package {data-menu-title="Why Create a Python Package (ii)"}

- Share your code:
  - Can be installed on any machine using a single command (`pip`/`conda`).
- Organise your code:
  - Packages can help organise large code projects.
  - Smaller, more manageable components.
  - Structure can help both supporting the codebase and making it easier to
    understand.

## What to Consider Before Creating a Package

- Who will use your package?
- How people might use your project?
- If relevant, what data will be used with your package?
- Have you got documentation and tests?
- How long will you be able to support it?

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = NO -->

## The Elements of a Python Package {data-menu-title="The Elements of a Python Package (i)"}

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = YES -->

- Code: functions and classes that contain the functionality.
- Documentation:
  - Installation instructions.
  - Tutorials.
  - Examples.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - Development documentation.

## The Elements of a Python Package {data-menu-title="The Elements of a Python Package (ii)"}

- Tests: ensure code works as expected.
- Open source licence:
  - Allows others to use your package.
  - Provides legal direction.
- Infrastructure:
  - Automate updates.
  - Test suites.
  - Release workflow.

## `README.md`

```{.markdown}
# Example Package

This is a simple example package. You can use
[GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
to write your content.
```

## Python Files

- `src/example_package/__init__.py`

  ```{.python}
  """
  The existence of an __init__.py file allows users to import the
  directory as a regular package, even if __init__.py is empty.
  """
  ```

- `src/example_package/example.py`

  ```{.python}
  def add_one(number):
      return number + 1
  ```

- `tests/`

  A placeholder for test files.

## `pyproject.toml`

`pyproject.toml` is a configuration file used by packaging tools, and other
tools such as linters, type checkers, and so on. This file can contain three
possible TOML tables.

- The `[build-system]` table is recommended. It allows one to declare the build
  backend to use.
- The `[project]` table specifies the project metadata and dependencies.
- The `[tool]` table has tool-specific subtables (e.g. `[tool.ruff]`).

## Build Backend

The `[build-system]` table has a `build-backend` key that specifies the build
backend to be used. The `requires` key includes a list of dependencies required
to build the project.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Hatchling

```{.toml}
[build-system]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
requires = [
    "hatchling",
]
```

## setuptools

```{.toml}
[build-system]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
requires = [
    "setuptools",
]
```

## Flit

```{.toml}
[build-system]
build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"
requires = [
    "flit_core",
]
```

## PDM

```{.toml}
[build-system]
build-backend = "pdm.backend"
requires = [
    "pdm-backend",
]
```

## uv-build

```{.toml}
[build-system]
build-backend = "uv_build"
requires = [
    "uv_build",
]
```

:::

## Dynamic Metadata

Most of the time static metadata can be written directly in the `[project]`
table. For example, `requires-python = ">= 3.10"` or `version = "1.0"`.

However, it is best when possible to set this metadata dynamically. One can
automate the `__version__` attribute by using the following.

```{.toml}
[project]
dynamic = [
    "version",
]
```

## Basic Information

- `name`: The name of the project on PyPI. Required field and cannot be made
  dynamic.

  ```{.toml}
  [project]
  name = "spam-eggs"
  ```

- `version`: The version of the project.

  ::: {.panel-tabset}

  ## Static

  ```{.toml}
  [project]
  version = "2020.0.0"
  ```

  ## Dynamic

  ```{.toml}
  [project]
  dynamic = [
    "version",
  ]
  ```

  :::

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = NO -->

## Dependencies and Requirements {data-menu-title="Dependencies and Requirements (i)" footer=false}

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = YES -->

- Dependencies are specified as follows.

  ```{.toml}
  [project]
  dependencies = [
      "django>2.0; os_name == 'nt'",
      "django>2.1; os_name != 'nt'",
      "gidgethub[httpx]>4.0.0",
      "httpx",
  ]
  ```

- Optional dependencies are further specified as follows.

  ```{.toml}
  [project.optional-dependencies]
  cli = [
      "rich",
      "click",
  ]
  gui = [
      "PyQt5",
  ]
  ```

## Dependencies and Requirements {data-menu-title="Dependencies and Requirements (ii)"}

- Optional dependencies can be installed by specifying the name in square
  brackets: `pip install example-project[gui]`.
- A new feature exists
  [dependency groups](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-groups)
  which is for optional dependencies that are only intended for development
  (linters, testing, …).
- The minimum Python version to support is specified as:

  ```{.toml}
  [project]
  requires-python = ">= 3.10"
  ```

## Executable Scripts

- A `spam-cli` command can be made using the following:

  ```{.toml}
  [project.scripts]
  spam-cli = "spam:main_cli"
  ```

- On Windows, scripts sometimes require the following command instead:

  ```{.toml}
  [project.gui-scripts]
  spam-gui = "spam:main_gui"
  ```

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = NO -->

## Project Metadata {data-menu-title="Project Metadata (i)"}

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = YES -->

      {name = "Tzu-Ping Chung", email = "tzu-ping@example.com"},
      {name = "Another person"},
      {email = "different.person@example.com"},
  ]
  maintainers = [
      {name = "Brett Cannon", email = "brett@example.com"},
  ]
  ```

- `description`

  ```{.toml}
  [project]
  description = "Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam!"
  ```

## Project Metadata {data-menu-title="Project Metadata (ii)"}

- `readme`

  ```{.toml}
  [project]
  readme = "README.md"
  ```

- Licences should be declared using the following two fields.

  ```{.toml}
  [project]
  license = "MIT"
  license-files = [
      "LICENSE",
  ]
  ```

- `keywords`

  ```{.toml}
  [project]

# Sharing Your Package

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = NO -->

## TestPyPI {data-menu-title="TestPyPI (i)"}

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = YES -->

1. `python3 -m pip install --upgrade build`
2. `python3 -m build`

   ```text
   dist/
   ├── example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
   └── example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1.tar.gz
   ```

   The `tar.gz` file is a source distribution whereas the `.whl file` is a built
   distribution. Newer `pip` will install the built distribution and only use
   the source as a fallback.

3. Create an account on [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/).
4. Set up API token and so on.

## TestPyPI {data-menu-title="TestPyPI (ii)"}

5. `python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine`
6. `python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`

   ```text
   Uploading distributions to https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
   Enter your API token:
   Uploading example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
   100% ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 8.2/8.2 kB • 00:01 • ?
   Uploading example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1.tar.gz
   100% ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 6.8/6.8 kB • 00:00 • ?
   ```

7. `python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps example-package-YOUR-USERNAME-HERE`

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = NO -->

## PyPI {data-menu-title="PyPI (i)"}

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = YES -->

A similar set of steps can be done to upload to PyPI. TestPyPI allows one to
test out their package. It is still public but much less obvious for people to
look. People will often do these steps through GitHub Actions.
