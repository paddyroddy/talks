# Overview

![](figures/quarto.jpg)

## An Open-Source Scientific and Technical Publishing System

- Author using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks or with plain text
  markdown in your favorite editor.
- Create dynamic content with
  [Python](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html),
  [R](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html),
  [Julia](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html), and
  [Observable](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html).
- Publish reproducible, production quality articles, presentations, dashboards,
  websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.

## An Open-Source Scientific and Technical Publishing System

- Share knowledge and insights organisation-wide by publishing to
  [Posit Connect](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/rstudio-connect.html),
  [Confluence](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/confluence.html), or other
  publishing systems.
- Write using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) markdown, including equations,
  citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.

## Python

> Combine Jupyter notebooks with flexible options to produce production quality
> output in a wide variety of formats. Author using traditional notebook UIs or
> with a plain text markdown representation of notebooks.

## R

:::{layout="[60,30,30]"}

> Quarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from Posit,
> with many new new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses
> [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr) to execute R code, and is therefore able to
> render most existing Rmd files without modification.

## Julia

:::{layout="[54,27,27]"}

> Combine markdown and Julia code to create dynamic documents that are fully
> reproducible. Quarto executes Julia code via the
> [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) Jupyter kernel, enabling you
> to author in plain text (as shown below) or render existing Jupyter notebooks.

## Observable

:::{layout="[58,29,29]"}

> Quarto includes native support for Observable JS, a set of JavaScript
> enhancements created by Mike Bostock (the author of D3). Observable JS uses a
> reactive execution model, and is especially well suited for interactive data
> exploration and analysis.
